package helper

// TODO: Add helper functions here
// Helper functions are functions that are used in the application but are not part of the business logic
// They are typically used to perform tasks such as logging, validation, etc.
// Helper functions should be in the helper package and not the service package
// Helper functions should be generic and not specific to the application
// Helper functions should be pure functions and not have any side effects
// Helper functions should be tested
// for example, a function that logs a message should be in the helper package
// a function that validates a request should be in the service package
// a function that logs a message should be in the helper package
// a function that hashes a password should be in the helper package
// a function that generates a token should be in the helper package
// a function that logs a message should be in the helper package

// helper functions should be stateless and not have any dependencies on the application state
